# Surfs Up Analysis

## Overview of Surfs Up Analysis:

W. Avy would like us to continue with our analysis by including more information on temperature trends before opening the surf shop.  Specficially he is looking for data from the months in June and December to confirm whether the business is sustainable to operate all year round.

## Summary
- High Level Summary
- 
- Additional Queries to run
  - Using two months to test whether the business is sustainable all year could result in incorrect information, I would suggest running a query that would look at each month to identify the extremes which may differ from June & December
  - Another recommendation would be to limit the query to the past two years rather than all years to see if more recent climate trends have different results
